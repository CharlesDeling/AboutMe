      <h1>Gaming</h1>
      <p>My first main hobby is gaming. I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember, making it my longest spanning hobby. I feel as though gaming has had a pretty major impact on my life. First of all, it has always been my go to way to destress as it allows me to disconnect from reality for a bit. Second of all, it has led to me meeting many of my closest friends today. Lastly, I honestly believe that gaming is what first sparked my interest in computers. It might just be the root of the reason for why I am studying what I am studying. Below are some of my favorite games that I have ever played.</p>

      <h1>Warhammer</h1>
      <p> My second main hobby is playing a tabletop game called Warhammer 40K with my friends. I have only been into 40K for about a year as of this point, yet it has quickly become one of my favorite things to do. I enjoy aspects of the hobby, from building the models, painting the models, reading the lore, and playing the game itself. I would try to explain the story behind 40k, yet that could easily take multiple pages to explain. However, I definitely recommend checking it out as it has some of the best story writing I have ever read. The tabletop game on the otherhand is a lot easier to explain. In short, you collect and build models that each have unique rules. Each model costs a certain number of points to field and you build up an army depending on how many points are going to be used in a game. For example, an average game is 2,000 points for each person, so if I add up the points cost of every model in my army, they must be less than or equal to 2,000 points. After each person has their armies, they fight each other using the rules that their models have. There are a lot more specifics than that, but this is just a brief description. My favorite aspect of this hobby is painting the miniatures. It's both relaxing and rewarding at the same time. I don't even know how many times I have spent a night listening to music and painting models. It honestly has the same impact that gaming does, it also allows me to disconnect from reality for a bit. It's also really nice to spend a couple of hours painting and have something completed that I painted myself. Plus, it really does make the experience of playing 40K on tabletop a lot more immersive than if I had unpainted models. However, probably the most important part of this hobby for me is that it reignited my creativity. When I was younger, I used to love sketching and painting, but I slowly lost my creativity and passion for it, which I believe to be partially caused by gaming. Yet, painting these miniatures has helped reignited that passion and creativity, which I truely am glad about. Below are some of my favorite models that I have painted up till this point.</p>

      <h1>Favorite Songs/Bands</h1>
      <p>My third main hobby is listening to music. I don't know if many people would call this a hobby, but I certainly do. I have always loved listening to music and it has definitely impacted my life significantly. When I was younger, I did not really have any specific genre that I listened to. However, as of the past couple of years, I have fallen in love with the metal genre and many of its subgenres, such as progressive metal and death metal. I think that the best part of this hobby is how accessible it is compared to my other hobbies. With gaming, I have to be at home. With playing 40K, my friends and I have to set up a time and go to a game store. With painting, I also have to be at home. Meanwhile, with music I can listen to it at anytime and while doing anything. Below are some of my favorite bands as of right now.</p>
